# Starmap
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook developed for the Computational Techniques course in the Astrophyisics Master in the University of La Laguna.  It analyzes astronomical data from **Hipparcos** and **Gaia** using **ADQL**, and then uses this data to create a star map centered on a specific location in right ascension and declination.
